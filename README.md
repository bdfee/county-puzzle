#US County Puzzle

This project uses US county topology data (TopoJSON) to render a puzzle of the contiguous 48 US states plus Alaska and Hawaii. States are provided and denoted by color, and the counties are scattered within reason around each state. The goal of the puzzle is to drag and drop the counties to their correct positions on the map.

The project is built with JavaScript and React, and it stores progress locally on your machine using browser storage. The puzzle is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
